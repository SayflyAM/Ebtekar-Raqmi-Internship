I have work on the dataset and we use need to predicte the Stock what I do I remove the Nan value from the colums I try to use LogisitcRegression so i get Accuracy  at  0.5036 so this show that thje model can not get realnships or pattren between Stock and other colums so from our last Task the correlation matrix show that we get value near zero 


The Goal I wanted to predicit Stock staus I try to use two feature Discoubnt and Rating and T had to trained a classification model specifically Decioison Tree
the result I had get the model achieved an accuracy of 49%
 so this low accuacy confirms that there is no strong correlation between these feature
